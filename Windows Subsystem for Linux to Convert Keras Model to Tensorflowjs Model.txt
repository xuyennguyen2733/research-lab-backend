 Context 
For our Signable web application, we want to evaluate signs in the frontend for better performance. To achieve this, we need to convert the keras model to tensorflowjs model. However, the conversion process fails because the package tensorflow_decision_forest isn’t supported in Windows. Therefore, if we are to convert our model on a Windows machine, we must do it via Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).

Getting Started
Open Windows PowerShell
Install WSL using the command: wsl –install
Install a specific distribution using the command: wsl -–install -d <distribution-name> (in this case I installed Ubuntu)
If installation fails, you may need to update wsl: wsl –update, then try again
Navigate to the project directory: cd /mnt/c/<the-rest-of-the-path> (notice that in wsl, C: is mounted to /mnt/c)
Install a virtual environment: python3 -m venv <my-venv-name>
In my case it’s ASLModelTraining. If you see this file already in the repo you don’t have to create another.
If installation fails because ensurepip is not available, run the follow commands to install the python3-venv package:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-dev python3-venv
Now run this command again and it should work: python3 -m venv <my-venv-name>
Activate the environment: source <my-venv-name>/bin/activate

Installing Dependencies
Install pip: sudo apt install python3-pip
Install tensorflowjs: pip install tensorflowjs
Double check that the package is there: pip list and look for tensorflowjs

Convert the model: tensorflowjs_converter \ --input_format=keras \ --output_node_names=<output_name> \ <path/to/keras/model.keras \ <path/to/output/directory

You can also run the script to train and export tfjs models directly if the command above doesn’t work.
	
Potential Errors
At first, I got the error “tensorflowjs_converter: command not found”, although tensorflowjs shows up on the list when I ran pip list
I tried re-installing tensorflowjs using a different command: python3 -m pip install tensorflowjs, only to run into error with pip. I had to run these command to install pip correctly:
	curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py
	python3 get-pip.py
Now that pip is installed correctly, I upgrade it and install tensorflowjs again:
	python3 -m pip install –upgrade pip
	python3 -m pip install tensorflowjs
And check to make sure tensorflowjs_converter is recognized:
	tensorflowjs_converter –version
Now, run step 4 in Installing Dependencies again.
